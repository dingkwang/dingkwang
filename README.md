Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I’ve just wrapped up my career as Perception Validation Engineer at [Aeva](aeva.ai). Alongside this, I am also a member of the San Francisco Bay Are [ZGZG machine learing study group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx4zDrBFx8g) study group.

I also contribute as a Developer at the [CatchOnLabs](https://github.com/nftblackmagic) where I focus on **Image Generative AI**, **Virtual TryOn**, and **multi-modal conversational agents**.

On the ccomputer vision front, I collaborate with [Dr. Sanjeev Loppal](https://focus.ece.ufl.edu/team/) at the **FOCUS LAB** at the **University of Florida** on projects that aim to empower the capability of **drone** and **autonomous vehicle**.


🌟🌟Feel free to reach out! Whether it’s for research, collaboration, or just to exchange ideas over a casual chat, I’m always open to connecting and exploring new possibilities!🌟🌟
